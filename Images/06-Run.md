### **3.4. RUN (Execute Commands)**

The **`RUN`** directive in a Dockerfile is used to execute commands in the shell during the build process of your Docker image. It allows you to install software packages, set up configurations, and perform any other setup required for your application.

---

#### **Purpose of `RUN`:**
- Executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image layer.
- Each `RUN` command creates a new intermediate image layer, which can affect the final image size.
- Commonly used to install packages, configure environments, and prepare your application.

---

#### **Usage:**
```dockerfile
RUN <command>
```

- **`<command>`**: The shell command you want to execute (e.g., `apt-get update`, `yum install`, `npm install`).

---

### **Example: Installing Packages in the Image**

Let's build a Dockerfile that sets up an Nginx web server:

```dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY custom-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

### **Explanation of the Example:**

1. **Base Image**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:20.04
   ```
   - Uses the official **Ubuntu 20.04** image as the base.

2. **Installing Nginx**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
   ```
   - **`apt-get update`**: Refreshes the package lists to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.
   - **`apt-get install -y nginx`**: Installs the Nginx web server. The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to prompts.

3. **Cleaning Up**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```
   - Cleans up cached files to reduce the Docker image size.
   - Helps in keeping the image lightweight by removing unnecessary files.

4. **Copy Configuration File**:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY custom-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```
   - Copies a custom Nginx configuration file from the host to the container.

5. **Expose Port**:
   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 80
   ```
   - Exposes port 80 for HTTP traffic.

6. **Starting Nginx**:
   ```dockerfile
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```
   - Keeps Nginx running in the foreground.

### **Example: Installing Multiple Packages**

You can chain multiple commands using `&&` to reduce the number of layers:

```dockerfile
# Using RUN to install multiple packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl vim git && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

- This approach helps minimize the number of image layers, making your image smaller and more efficient.

---

### **Best Practices for Using `RUN`**:

1. **Minimize Layers**:
   - Combine multiple commands into a single `RUN` statement using `&&` to reduce the number of layers:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package1 package2 && apt-get clean
     ```

2. **Use `\` for Readability**:
   - For better readability, especially with long commands, use backslashes (`\`):
     ```dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && \
         apt-get install -y python3-pip && \
         apt-get clean
     ```

3. **Clean Up After Installing**:
   - Always clean up package lists and cache files to reduce the final image size:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
     ```

4. **Use `--no-install-recommends` (For Debian/Ubuntu)**:
   - This option prevents installing extra recommended packages, reducing the image size:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nginx
     ```

5. **Consider Using `COPY` or `ADD`**:
   - For copying files or adding archives, use `COPY` or `ADD` instead of running unnecessary shell commands with `RUN`.
